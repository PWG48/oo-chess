# What went well
-Chess program is functioning
-Team was able to attend last minute meetings to ensure the completion of the assignment
-Avoided merge conflicts even though we were working in the same file at times
-Team was able to successfully complete work when it was needed
    -dependable and reliable teamates

# What went badly
-Could have spent more time working on the project
    -a lot of work was done last minute
-Communication could have been better about who was doing what portion of the assignment
-Communication on the design (prior to coding) could have been improved, so the team could all be on the same page for the implementation
-Hard to communicate effectively since we are all technically part time and remote for this class
